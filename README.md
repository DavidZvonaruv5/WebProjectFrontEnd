2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd WebProjectFrontEnd`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the application: `npm start`
5. in order to make the site functional, clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/DavidZvonaruv5/WebProject.git` in a different instance of VSCode, navagate to the directory, install dependencies and start the application via `npm start`.
6. now you can fully interact with the site!

After running `npm start`, the application should open in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once you have the TaskFlow frontend and backend running, you can interact with the application through your web browser.

Here are the main features you can use:

### User Login

To use TaskFlow, you need to log in to an account. Only an admin can sign you up. This is designed to be a system for tech companies where the team leader signs up each of his team members. 

For example, to log in as an employee, the username is "Dor" and the password is "123456". This corresponds to a person named Dor that works in the company.
### Viewing and Assigning Notes

Once logged in, you can view your notes on the dashboard. If you're an admin or a team leader, you can also assign notes to your team members.

### Live Chat

TaskFlow includes a live chat feature. You can use this to communicate with your team members in real time.

### Admin Features

If you're an admin, you have additional features available. You can remove users and view everyone's notes.

Please note that this is a system for tech companies, and the team leader signs up each of his team members. Only admins have the ability to remove users and view everyone's notes.
